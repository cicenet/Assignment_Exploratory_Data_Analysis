# Assignment_Exploratory_Data_Analysis

In this repository are the files of first assigment of Exploratory Data Analysis Course that uses data from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the “Individual household electric power consumption Data Set” 

which I have made available on the course web site:
Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

According to original instructions:
* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
* Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
* Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
* Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository (no need for separate sub-folders)

In this repository are four code files with ".R" extension and four graphic files with ".png" extension
